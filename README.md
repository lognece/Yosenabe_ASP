# Yosenabe Project

This was a project for the course Artificial Inteligence at the University of Potsdam. The tests were pre-written by the teaching team. My solution you can find here: [yosenabe.lp](asp/yosenabe.lp).

The instructions that were given for the project are in this file: [yosenabe.ipynb](yosenabe.ipynb).

The command call for the test is:

* ``python3.8 asp/test.py -e asp/yosenabe.lp -i asp/instances -s asp/solutions -t 180``
